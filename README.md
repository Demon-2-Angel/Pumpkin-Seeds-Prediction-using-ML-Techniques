# Pumpkin-Seeds-Prediction-using-ML-Techniques
I have explored the prediction of Pumpkin seeds found in Turkiye based on 13 features.

# Conclusion
1. <b>KNN</b> - It is used for unsupervised Learning, that's why I tried just 4 fun by removing <strong>"Class"</strong>
2. <b>Decision Tree</b> - Pruning gives better results around accuracy between 73% to 85%
3. <b>Random Forest with Bagging</b> - gives good results around 83%
4. <b>Logistic Regression</b> - Also provide good result of around 87%
